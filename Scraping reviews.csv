A conservative style, reliability and a reasonable price. I have had the watch for about 3 years now and the original battery is still running. The band is genuine leather and is easily interchangeable with the black leather version that Fossil makes without the use of special tools (there is small lever on the pin). This makes it fashionable no matter the attire you wear (brown shoes/belt = brown band, black shoes/belt = black band). The timing function works, but buttons tend to be stiff and only one seems to work. However, I did not purchase it for the timing function and rarely use it. It keeps great time, and the large roman numerals are easy to read from an arm's length away.I assume because it has a leather band you are not planning to take it under the water/in the shower. However, the crown tends to wiggle open after long periods of being worn. The crown has engraved ridges that get pulled by the skin as the wrist moves. This is very minor though.  Beyond washing your hands, I would not take this near water.

Higher quality than I expected for the price.  Visible, working gears make it a fun distraction while waiting.  Highly recommend.

I bought this replacement of the same model watch due to a catastrophic fall which broke the previous one.  The watch face is black which is a perfect contrast with the light minute/hour hands as well as the light hour markers. This would be my third Fossil watch. I love the quality.Cons: it comes with a thick leather band and is comfortable, however, the watch will roll around your wrist for about 3 weeks which is how long it takes the leather to conform to your wrist shape. Believe me when I say it’s well worth the wait. I receive lots of compliments about this watch.

This watch in the rose gold / blue is fantastic.  It looks better in person than in the photos.  The band is comfortable and is quality leather.  The hands do have lume and glow well in the dark.  You are getting a lot in this watch for a cheap price point.  I totally recommend this watch.

I have been a Fossil and Amazon customer for years.  I was looking on the Fossil site and found this watch and thought I wonder if Amazon sells Fossil because I had Gift Cards for my birthday and this was going to be a rare present to myself. I was very pleased to find that one on the Amazon site. Fossil comes in collectible tins which I have several of from over the years.  I received my package and it was the standard thin plastic bag for socks or a sweater this should have been in a box or bubble mailer at the minimum. The tin was open, bent up, and it was missing the actual piece that the watch sits on to hold its shape.  The watch was loose in the bag. I was very disappointed. After close inspection, the watch and leather band were still in great condition. The tin is useless to me now and I don't have a place to store my watch when not wearing it.  As for the watch itself, I am very happy with my purchase. The size color and function are all as expected! I am glad once again I suggested Amazon GCs as a gift. Please package more methodically for shipping.  This is the first disappointing experience I have had ordering through your site. If you would replace my 1954 #7 tin I would be very grateful.

Es un reloj que si te gusta el estilo clasico te va a encantar. Se siente de calidad en el Peso y es bastante comodo en el tacto. Es sumergible hasta 5 Atm y de Aceso Inoxidable. La unica pega que le puedo poner es que en oscuridad a penas se ve el Dial de Horas y minutos (en mi caso particular esto es irrelevante). Si logras conseguirlo en oferta es un golaso!

 A gem at this price range, another Titan to my wardrobe collection.  Prefect to style with any formal and attire. Perfect to gift your beloved. Appearance is solid. Comes with date feature. Unlike other brands, the strap is good and flexible. Other brands have their strap very hard that hairs get stuck in the strap. Awesome!! Go for it!!

Considering the brand's reputation and the watch's overall build quality and design, the Titan Watch is reasonably priced. It offers good value for money, especially for those seeking a reliable and stylish timepiece on a budget.classic and elegant timepiecesWhether you are a watch collector or looking for a gift, the Titan watchs are definitely worth considering.

 This is the only review you need to read honestly.I recently had an itch for a Cartier Tank but decided to hang on till there's a special occasion. So i bought this to calm my itch for a while. It's better looking than the other 2 Tank clones that Titan sells, mainly due to the size. Both the other watches are like wearing a wall clock on your wrist. If they were available in the size of Titan Karishma, I'd buy them in a heart beat. Also a sapphire crystal would be appreciated.The main concern with Titan watches is that since the beginning, their cheaper watches bite the hair on your wrist. It's such a shame that there's absolutely no difference between a late 80's - 90's Titan and a modern Titan watch strap. My dad's 90's EXACTA has the same kind of strap and it removed the hair on his arms better than applying Veet, but more painful.The day the watch came in, I pulled the strap off and threw it out of the window and put a leather strap and it looks so much classier.The another bad thing with this watch is that it fits a 16mm strap size. They don't specify it anywhere and the customer support themselves don't know what size it fits. I measured it manually.If you get a true 16mm strap it will look like a ladies watch with still wierd proportions, mainly because of the weird hood they have welded to its lugs. So what i did was that I asked a jugadu watch repair person to get a 20mm strap and cut the ends 2mm each side and viola, it looks so much better. The extra 650 rupees I spent to make this watch wearable was so worth it.Registering of warranty is relatively easy. Just scan the card included and download the invoice from Amazon beforehand.Weight of the watch is good and is built nicely.Size is great for a dress watch or for something low profile.I however feel that the dial needs to be either completely white or silver. The landing strip in between of the dial is out of place but the indices almost save it's look.Overall, this watch is a better Tank replacement if you can retrofit a 20mm leather strap like I did, or if you regularly shave your arm hair. The strap, the wierd lugs and the shiny landing strip on the dial is the reason I gave it 3 stars. If you can look past it, its a very solid and elegant looking modern Titan.It's about time that Titan starts to transition into a luxury watch brand with unique designs, automatic movements and dials at an affordable price due to make in India initiate and atleast compete with the likes of Seiko.

I'm a woman and have very small wrists. I wanted a larger watch that I could easily read without squinting or putting on glasses as I don't like wearing glasses that much as I don't need them for my computer. But, I didn't want a huge watch. So, this watch was large without being huge. I knew that the band would not fit snugly, but this band was said by other reviewers to be a big small on them. I like bands to be loose so that they can sit down on my hand when I have long sleeves on or be pushed up a few inches on my arm when I'm doing something messy like cooking dinner. I also wanted an inexpensive but dependable and classic looking watch. Because it became fashionable for women to wear watches that looked like they'd borrowed them from the guy in their life, I felt this would be fine without seeming too odd.Also, I like to check the time when I wake up because I wake up so early and don't want to get up so early that I'll be exhausted later. So, the light was important to me. I've had a few Timex watches before, and I found the Indiglo feature very helpful.I was a little concerned about the stretch band pulling my arm hairs as I'd noticed on a watch a long time ago that that happened. This one very so slightly does that but mainly because it's loose and I move it around. If it were fit so it stayed put on my arm, I don't think it would do that throughout the day. It's not actually a problem as it's so slight. I don't really notice it much.As I said, I've had a few Timex watches in my life, and they tend to keep on ticking. My last one, honestly, didn't last more than 18 months, but that was an exception. Fortunately, I got that one very, very cheaply on a sale with points and so on at another retailer. I hope this one lasts for a few years as it has for others.While I like the dull metal stretch band, I am also considering getting silicone bands in different colors. They are pretty inexpensive, and you can get the quick release type that pop in and out easily to be worn with different outfits. I'm thinking of black, buff/pink (kind of like a white person's slightly tanned skin), and red. Maybe white too. For now, I'm just using the silver band. As another reviewer mentioned, the provided band is duller than the watch. However, it actually looks good that way. It's a more casual look than it would be with a shiny band. I also think it would look good with a shiny band, however.So, having read that some people had difficulty setting the day of the week, I handed this to my young adult son as he was just sitting around playing on his computer while to did all kinds of housework. He set everything but the day and didn't bother with the day of the week. Not intending to be his slave without any rewards, I looked up directions on the internet, sent them to him, and handed it back with just enough words to every so slightly shame him into doing it. I wasn't mean, but this kid got accepted to MIT. So, he did it. I also asked here for directions and got directions from the manufacturer and several other reviewers. So, look through the questions and the answers are there. Basically, you pull the knob out and turn it through as many 24-hour days as you need to to get to the day of the week you need. I think you go clockwise. The direction matters, so check that first. It's absolutely NOT a big deal once you know how to do it. I think the reason so many people have gotten confused is that these days were are used to clicking on things and having them set right away. It's the same reason many older people have trouble with digital things. They are used to mechanical things. Anyway, it's not a big deal and it's definitely not a reason not to buy the watch.As I said, I bought this watch because it had a big face and hands and would be easy to glance at without glasses AND because it had Indiglo lighting when you push the knob AND because it had both the day and the date. I do check my online calendar daily and schedule appointments every single day for my business and personal matters. However, I admit sometimes I forget what day it is and what the date is. One reason I didn't buy the women's version of this watch is that I wanted the DAY and the date, not just the date. The women's version must be too small to have both. What I've noticed is that in dim light, I have a harder time reading small print. Also, the day and date are much smaller than the numerals for the hours. That's normal, of course. But, I do have to work a little harder to read the day and date. Further, the day and date are not illuminated by the Indiglo light. I guess because this is a mechanical watch, they are turning on different disks and don't have that feature. However, when I check my watch in the dark, I only want to know what time it is and don't need to know the day of the week and date. So, it's not actually a problem. The only thing I would say about that is that because I can read it but it's harder to read and I rarely go without my phone, the day/date feature is probably not as important to me as I made it when I made the choice of the watch. I probably could have gotten the women's version and been happy with it.As for this man's watch on me, I had the idea that women's watches are frumpy looking and liked the idea of a bigger watch face, but I probably would like the utilitarian look of this watch in the women's size. I just got this so will think about this overnight. When I pinch about 5 of the links out, the watch actually looks pretty good and not like I borrowed a man's watch. So, removing some links is also an option. As I said, my wrist is tiny, and so many women would not need to remove any links to make this watch fit and some might have to add links. If I removed 8 links, it would be snug on me, but I wouldn't be able to dangle it down on my hand if I had long sleeves with snug cuffs or push it up on my arm if I were doing something messy. So, I do have options: loose if I do nothing, snug if I remove 8 links, and semi-fitted if I remove only 5 links.And, I can use quick release silicone bands to change the look to go with different outfits. I figured out that if I got the black band, that would work for business as it almost without looking closely would come off as a black leather band. It would also have a soft, comfortable feel (based on reviews and if you get the ones that are like that so read the reviews before buying). Although I don't mind the metal expansion band and didn't notice it when I wore this for an hour on an errand, I probably would love the soft silicone bands. I'm middle aged and healthy, but if you were older or had very delicate skin for other reasons, a soft silicone band would be a great option for you. You can get soft leather bands that would feel nice, but silicone is easier to clean, can be gotten wet without staining or swelling, and is sturdy. As it is, my skin is healthy, but I have sensitive skin, not thick or rough. I can't wear pierced earrings with nickle in them. I don't think that will be an issue for this watch as it never has been for a Timex before. but I did notice that one reviewer had removed the band but left the little bars in and looped a one-piece leather band through the bars so that there was almost no skin contact with the metal. If you want to look DIY or artsy, you can even make padded fabric watchbands that have snaps to hold the watch face or use thick grosgrain ribbon to make bands to your color preference. I would even sew velvet ribbon to grosgrain ribbon or sew lace to grosgrain ribbon to make a cute band for certain casual fun outfits or a slightly dressed up event where casual touches would look cute. Because this is so inexpensive and supplies for making watch bands would be cheap due to the size needed, you could give one of these to a teen and help them come up with lots of different bands for it. You can buy band hardware (buckles, etc.) easily online.The other thing to consider if you're very small boned is that larger watch will be heavier. My son, who is 6 feet tall and energetic, walking miles fast rather than driving, and fairly strong, also has small wrists and pointed out to me that a larger watch might feel heavy. He'd been given one years ago and took it off regularly as a result. He took it off in the orchestra room while playing his cello, and someone stole it. Having said that, this is smaller than many large-faced men's watches. It's not one of those huge watches. It covers about 2/3 of my wrist width, not all of it like many men's watches would. Although I noticed the weight when I put it on because my son advised me to consider that, it didn't bother me. With a silicone, fabric, or leather band, it would be even lighter. Heavier than most women's watches, but not as heavy as those chunky men's watches.When considering how practical it is to have a men's watch, I also considered size related to the small cuffed long sleeve shirts and long sleeved sweaters one might wear to work. How much of a hassle would it be to dig under my sleeve to get to the watch in a meeting? Truth is that I could wear this watch over a long sleeved thin sweater and get away with it because my clothes are so classic and practical. Also, because I live in Los Angeles where it's hot a lot and I am a woman who prefers short sleeves and jackets or cardigans to long sleeves as my main layer to avoid hot flashes, this is really not an issue for me. I also have the option of giving this watch to my son if I decide I want a smaller one and never wear it. However, I don't think he's taken the watch I gave him five years ago off since I gave it to him. So, that's all theoretical.In conclusion, I would say that this watch is a realistic purchase for a woman, even if she has small wrists. If she has very delicate skin as elderly people often do or wants it to be lighter, you can find some very nice, very inexpensive silicone watchbands that are easily cleaned and easily interchangeable with quick release pins. If she needs something breathable due to the heat, you could go with a thin leather band, a ribbon band (a thick ribbon or two layers of ribbon due to the weight and width) or a fabric band that you make or get on a crafter sales site. Or, she could wear it over a washable wrist band or a long sleeve. I personally think this is a great watch for teenage girls and boys if they would enjoy an analog watch because they can have fun with different bands.Edited to add: I slept with this watch on, but to be comfortable doing so, I put the watch over my sleeve on my long sleeved pajama top. I'm a person who doesn't like rough feeling surfaces on my skin, and so this made it comfortable to sleep in, and I didn't notice it during the night. The weight didn't bother me either. I have a feeling that silicone bands are in my near future unless I figure out a clever way to line the band with something soft. This is not a criticism of the band as it's a normal expansion band. But, I like smooth, soft surfaces next to my skin.Also, for those who have not had the Indiglo watch face light before, the more you use it, the faster your battery dies. It's not a big deal as the battery will last long enough, but just remember that and don't give it to a kid to play with for hours unless you want to replace the battery soon.And, I already have enjoyed the day/date feature as I woke up wondering if it was Thursday or Friday and glance at it first thing after I turned the light on at 4:30 a.m.Some might wonder why you'd buy a watch with an expansion band if you really want something softer next to your skin. For me, this 35mm watch face was a better size than the 40 mm  Weekender Unisex watch Timex sells AND it has both the day and date whereas the Weekender Unisex has neither the day nor date. You can spend upwards of $40 for the Weekender Unisex with a grosgrain ribbon band or you can buy this and then go get whatever band you want. The silicone bands I like are very well reviewed and go for less than $12 apiece, so it's about the same price to get a quick release band plus the watch at a slightly smaller size that is better for me than to buy the Weekender Unisex model that is a little too big, doesn't have the day/date, and also might not have the color I want. I like the grosgrain bands a lot as they are comfortable and you can get them in lots of colors. But, you do have to wash them regularly. To wash them, I mix a little laundry detergent in very hot water in a small container, like a cup--just about half a cup of water is fine--enough to cover. Then, let it sit for several hours in that and then rub so that all the loosened soil and oil from your skin comes off, rinse in running water while rubbing and soak again in hot water to rinse. If you have to do that regularly, it helps to have another band or another watch unless you don't mind not wearing the watch for several hours. They might be more comfortable than silicone because they breathe, but the silicone can be washed and dried within minutes. For this watch to use a slip through band like the grosgain bands you can buy or make, you need the posts and I assume but don't know that you can just use the posts provided with this band. You can also buy them to make this watch accept slip through bands.

This is my fourth Timex watch. I have an Expedition Scout with a Leather Strap and two Fairfield Chronograph 41mm in different colors. I chose the Easy Reader because it’s smaller (35 millimeter) and very easy to read. I must admit it’s taking me awhile to get use to the smaller case, but getting comfortable with it. All my other watches have larger cases.  While I have an iWatch and Omega Seamaster, the Timex watches are my go to watches for everyday use working around the house and yard. While they are inexpensive, they keep accurate time, look good and last for years.

Timex has always been a good watch this one is no different. The only thing I didn't care for was no instructions came with it, you have to go to their website and it's not really item specific but fortunately for me I've had one similar to this and could figure out how to set time, day and date. Looks good and it has a nice band that fits just right. Face is easy to read with light colored numerals on a dark face, indigo light is nice. So far, I've only had it one week, I'm pleased with it.

This is probably one of the best minimalist watches out for this price. My only issue is that the leather strap is very flimsy and wears down quickly. If you wear it often, it may not last more than a few months. The watch ticking is also quite loud, which may be a dealbreaker to some, especially if silence is required, but is fine with me personally.
"

Easy to read for old eyes. The indiglo light is wonderful. At work young and old love it and think it must of cost a small fortune. I love the ticktock sound and the motion of the second hand. Brings back great memories!
"

I was worried about this watch. Usually buying inexpensive means you get junk. But, because it was a Timex, I decided to buy it anyway. I'm impressed that Timex makes an inexpensive watch that does so well. The band fits my husbands large wrists well. The band is well made and holding up great. It is easy to read and the built in light is a great addition. Highly recommend.

Very nice looking, easy to read. Nice bright light. Good fitting. Well worth the money.

It all started when I misplaced my trusty 21 jewels Japanese automatic. Don’t ask me how it happened but it did. I’m a dad of two, self-employed, always in some sort of situation or another, and no one has accused me of being organized. It’s probably within twenty feet of me right now, but it could be on the other side of the world for all I know. At any rate, it wasn’t on my wrist anymore and I felt naked. Sure, I’ve got a phone, but I grew up with a watch, spent a lot of time learning to tell time when I was five or six, and I’m damn sure not letting that all go to waste. I had to find a decent substitute watch until mine turned up. Something affordable, something solid, something utilitarian yet pleasing to the eye. Something that could take a lickin’ and keep on tickin’. That’s it! A Timex. My first watch was a seven dollar Timex I bought with my own money when I was six. I can still remember my dad taking me to the local drugstore after school. It was a yellow brass case Easy Reader with a black rubber strap. A man’s watch, huge on my scrawny boy wrist, but I loved it and had it for many years until at some point it disappeared….See a recurring theme here?So I began my search for a watch that wouldn’t break the bank or, well, break. As I browsed, I came to this one – the Timex Easy Reader T20461. I immediately loved the look of it with its white face, Helvetica numbers, red 24-hour feature, silver-brass case, and stainless steel expander bracelet - which reminded me of the twist-o-flex watch bands my dad and grandfather always wore. The watch itself is akin to much more expensive “railroad” watches I had admired, but never considered buying. Without thinking twice I threw it into my cart, checked out and the man in brown brought it to my door within two days.Upon opening the box I wasn't disappointed. It looked better than the photos, felt solid and was easy to set. Yeah, the day and date require a little extra effort, but if this ruins your week you probably shouldn't get out of bed. It was the first time I wore an expander watch band and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn’t pinch my arm hair at all. I’m no gorilla, but I’m not in kindergarten anymore either. One thing did bother me, though. While I appreciated the band, the way it tapers just looked a little lady-like on my wrist. Or maybe it was my wrist making the watchband look lady-like. Who knows? It didn’t bother me too much and I loved the watch, so thought nothing more of it. That is, until I happened upon a watchstrap rack at a large big box store that shall remain unnamed. Hanging there was collection of the old school twist-o-flex expander bracelets I remembered so fondly from my dad and granddad. I found one that matched the shine of the watch case (the original band is a bit dull by comparison), paid a whopping 7 bucks for it (solid stainless steel), took it home, removed a few links to fit my lady-like wrist (it’s not hard – you just need a decent pocket knife and a set of needle-nosed pliers or tweezers), slid it on my wrist and voila! The perfect watch for me. Easy on, easy off; tasteful styling; understated; doesn’t scream “look at me, I spend too much money on stuff because I feel inadequate!” or “Mug me! I’m obviously fiscally irresponsible so relieve me of my money!”I hope I don’t lose it, but if I do…it’s easy to replace.  I wear it with pride and can’t recommend it highly enough for men like me that need a practical, no-nonsense, solid, reliable, unpretentious timepiece. So far it’s been dropped several times, drooled on, had coffee spilled on it and I forgot to take it off when I jumped in the shower the other day. Still as good as new. Oh yeah, Indiglo can’t be beat. You might have a Rolex, but your Rolex doesn’t have Idiglo.Sorry to say my other watch still hasn’t turned up. If it does, I’ll be happy to see it, give it a hug, then place it safely in my sock drawer until next time we meet.UPDATE: Still taking a lickin' and keeps on tickin'. Has a few character marks now, but runs as well as the day I bought it. Doesn't seem to gain or lose a second. I rarely take it off so it experiences whatever I do. I have, however, traded in the stretchy band for a leather nato that I snagged off another Timex (see pic).

I bought this watch after continually have problems with my fancy ""do everything"" computerized watch.  I don't need my glasses to read it, I don't have to scroll through anything just to see the time, and if it's dark I can light up the face.  The band doesn't need to be replaced every so often because it wears out and breaks, I don't have to charge it at night, and it comes on and off easily without having to fiddle with a clasp or buckle.  I can just push it up my arm a little so it doesn't get wet while washing my hands.  Wonderfully fuss free!  I love it!  Edited to add:  the band was a little big for me, and I took it to a jewelry store to have one of the links removed.  It fits perfectly now and this fix was well worth it.

I got this watch from the Warehouse.  Be careful to view the thumbnail since it might differ from the item pictured.  In my case, stainless and gold plated, the bracelet looked more expensive in the Warehouse thumbnail and in fact did once received.  Also since Timex batteries are so longlasting, older stock is not much of an issue. The bracelet is great with plenty of stretch.  I would also opt for the smaller watch since the face is so clean and the numbers so readable that the watch looks bigger on.  My only comment is that I wish the second hand were thicker.  It is barely visible.

I love that it's slim, simplistic, and the navy band is a really great look. Definitely worth the price (which was also reasonable!)

This watch has a titanium case and bracelet and a flat sapphire crystal. These features make this Seiko SUR371 lighter and much more scratch resistant. For those of you who want a nice and sturdy quartz watch for a very nice price of about $156, this one will do very nicely.One minor downside is that as the second hand ticks, it doesn’t line up with section of the second marks around the dial.

Really nice watch for the money, comfortable and light wieght.

For a titanium watch with a sapphire crystal, you're not going to do better than this. It's a Seiko, and you know that they always outkick their coverage on finishing. My new go to everyday watch. Also nice enough to wear on a night out. 40 mm wears well on my 7"" wrist. For the price, definitely recommend adding it to your collection.

Very nice looking watch and being titanium light weight. It comes with a kit that allows you to adjust the wrist band yourself and it was simple to do. That was fantastic as I was able to enjoy the watch immediately and did not have to pay a jeweler.

This was to replace my last Seiko watch that I had for ten years, and got beat up on the job, this newer version of my last one is slightly bigger, however, it is considerably lighter, and they were both Titanium, and with Sapphire crystal's, it keeps perfect time, thankfully its still made in Japan.

I have worn SEIKO wrist watches for decades.  It’s not a gadget, it’s a sturdy, reliable watch that can be worn continuously through all daily activities, exercise, etc.  Delivery was on time as scheduled.
